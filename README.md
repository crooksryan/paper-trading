# Web App for Paper Trading
Web application with back end written in Python with Flask. Users will be able to make an account and sign in and then "print" paper money to trade on stocks in real time

### Future Features
I intend to encorporate ML to determine if the current day is a good day to invest based of historical data of the S&P 500.
